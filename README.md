## 🌼 Pandas Sandbox 3000

Welcome to the Pandas playground - a place where I mess around with the data and some pandas tricks.

## What’s inside
- playground.ipynb - my main notebook where all the shit experiments happen
- dataset_template.csv - a sample dataset with 500+ rows of fake city cam events (cars, people, incidents, etc.)
- random experiments

## How to use
I highly do NOT recommend using it for any serious work or production stuff. You may accidentally break things that already work, or overheat your CPU :) 
Use responsibly.

## Stack
- Python 3.10+
- pandas
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Contributors
- Just me for now, but if you wanna join, we’ll probably make it a party
